# rock-paper-scissors-TIMEMACHINE!!!

```
Rock-Paper-Scissors-TIMEMACHINE-cannibal, is a Rock Paper Scissors variant game. It uses conditional logic to determine how the user's choices will be affected by the randomly generated computer choices. As the game progresses, the user and computer both gain access to modifiers that will change the outcomes, such as tie breakers and playing against hands from the past. It's super awesome.
